Texture Packing is to pack multiple rectangle shaped textures into one large texture.  The resulting texture must have a given width and a minimum height.

This project requires you to design an approximation algorithm that runs in polynomial time.  You must generate test cases of different sizes (from 10 to 10,000) with different distributions of widths and heights.  A thorough analysis on all the factors that might affect the approximation ratio of your proposed algorithm is expected.

纹理打包是将多个矩形纹理合并为一个大的纹理。最终的纹理必须具有给定的宽度和最小高度。

本项目要求您设计一个近似算法，其运行时间为多项式时间。您需要生成不同大小的测试用例（从10到10,000）以及宽度和高度的不同分布。
需要对您提出的算法的准确率进行全面的分析。

## Notice
**Bonus**: Compare your algorithm to any of the known strip algorithms.

**Note**: Anyone who does excellent job on answering the Bonus question will gain an extra point.
